"Don't use <div> tags to make clickable elements.
Use <a> or <button> elements. This enables browsers with JavaScript disabled to interact with them as expected.
Even if your functionality requires JavaScript and there is no reasonable default behaviour you can assign to an <a>,
use it regardless - it conveys 'clickable' semantics.
In general, choose the tag that most closely describes the function of its content,
not the appearance of its content, and avoid unnecessary <div> tags less your documents suffer from divitis."
